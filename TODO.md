# TODO

## Add view for per store events for a day
Admin should be able to look at the current day and see if everything aligns. It should be possible to delete todays events so they could be readed for corrections.

## Add posibility to switch month backwards in View Logs
In View logs we should be able to look at previous month state for a person

## Add toasters for adding entities.
Generally a better UX to have toasters everywhere possible.
